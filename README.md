# Predicting-Depression

- INTRODUCTION -

Mental health issues are largely taboo in India. In 2017, mental disorders were the second leading cause in terms of years lived with disability worldwide.
Never before has the world put mental health on a pedestal as high as it has now. Fortunately, the problem has pushed several national and international
organisations to consider including mental health policies as a priority and make it a part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).56 Million Indians
Suffered From Depression According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), India's mental health workforce is severely understaffed.[1] It has predicted
that owing to the pandemic and its influential factors, the number of patients who have any mental disorders would touch 20 per cent in the country.
Roughly 56 million Indians suffer from depression, and 38 million suffer from some anxiety disorder. India has one of the highest prevalences of mental 
illnesses globally. The National Mental Health Survey 2016 found that close to 14 per cent of India's population required active mental health 
interventions. Every year, about 2,00,000 Indians take their lives. The statistics are even higher if one starts to include the number of attempts to 
suicide.
